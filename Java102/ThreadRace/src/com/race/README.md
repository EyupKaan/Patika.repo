<b>We're an ArrayList win from 1 to 10000 (10 thousand). After that, divide this ArrayList into 4 equal parts so that 10 thousand parts are 2500 parts.Design 4 separate Threads that find odd and doublet in these 4 separate 2500-element Arrays.</b>
<li> The even numbers 4 Thread finds will be added to a common ArrayList.
  <li> The odd numbers that 4 Thread finds will be added to a common ArrayList.
    <li> ArrayLists holding odd and even numbers will be empty the first time they are created. And they will be two ArrayLists.
     <li> 4 When Thread starts processing its own 2500-element ArrayList, it will fill the odd and even number ArrayLists.
